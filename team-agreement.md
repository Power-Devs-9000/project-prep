# Team Agreement

## Cooperation Plan
  - Logan: Attention to detail, persistence, high motivation. Logan will be able to spot any minor adjustments needed in regards to code or styling with his attention to detail.  He is comfortable with working through his problems with breaking things and rebuilding.  He does not let the obstructions of learning hamper his attitude. Logan wants to continue to improve his technical skills and being open to receiving help more often throughout the project.
  
  - Reece: Debugging, problem solution planning, big picture. Reece has a keen eye for finding errors in code.  He is able to think out how to solve the problems needed to complete the project and understand how the small things fit into the grand project. He wants to increase his technical skills as he progresses through the project.
  
  - Ryan E: loop king, CSS(kinda). Ryan has a strong handle on how to handle grabbing information from arrays or objects using loops.  Although CSS can be annoying for him, he continues to pursue it with great passion. Ryan wants to work on his technical craft competency with a focus in HTML.
  
  - Darshon: CSS, time management, perseverance. Darshon has experience graphic design that will translate over well with his CSS skills.  He is able to properly plan out his tasks and stay on track with his time management.  His perseverance will keep the team on track as we progress through the project. Darshon wants to continue to improve his communication between team members and improve his technical skills surrounding functions in JS.
  
  - Day-to-day planning: We intend on utilzing the project board on GitHub to ensure everyone knows what their tasks are everyday and allows us to keep track of how we are all doing.  Along with having the project board, always keeping open lines of communication with each other to ensure we can help when needed.
## Conflict Plan
  - Approach the conflict with psychological safety in mind.  We will ensure everyone can address their concerns towards the conflict in an accepting and unbiased enviroment.
  - We will convene as a team and talk over the worries people may be having towards the individual that is strong arming the other members.  We will have a calm and respectful conversation with each other to try and resolve it at our level.
  - Everyone will be understanding of each other's skill level and life outside of the classroom.  We are all adults with lives outside of this course and we know to be respectful towards each other's time and other commitments.  We will not expect unrealistic commitments from anyone.
  - Have a simple conversation to figure out why they are not contributing as much as needed.  Ensure we provided accurate expectations and goals for them to achieve and work together if needed.  Keeping open communication if we are stuck or need help will prevent this from happening.
  - We will approach our instructor, Audrey, if we are unable to resolve a conflict on our own.  We will address the concern to her if we believe it becomes a hinderance to our ability to complete the project.
## Communication Plan
  - We have two members on the east coast and two on the west coast so we will keep our communication to no longer than 8 pm EST. 
  - We will be using slack, discord, zoom(if needed), and phone.
  - We intend on keeping with the normal pattern of taking a small break every hour if needed.
  - Address the concern with Audrey if we believe it to be detrimental to our project.  We all agree that if we fall behind we will put in extra work where our lives will permit.
  - We will communicate via discord or slack on weekends/after hours.
  - Keep in line with psychological safety lessons we learned to ensure everyone is heard.
  - Conversation turn taking, displaying empathy, accepting to all ideas, and actively listening.
## Work Plan
  -We intend on using the GitHub projects board to assign tasks and track when they are being completed.
